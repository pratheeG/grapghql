## Introduction

The repository is to learn the GraphQl along with me and to master in it.


## Getting started

Follow the steps below to run the application in your local machine

```
cd repo_to_clone
git clone https://github.com/pratheeG/graphql.git
cd graphql
git checkout graphql-setup
npm i
npm start
```


Once you followed the above steps, your applications starts on the PORT 9000.

Open your favorite browser and pass the URL `http://localhost:9000/graphql`

You'll be redirected to the sandbox page. Now you can give your own query / mutations.
